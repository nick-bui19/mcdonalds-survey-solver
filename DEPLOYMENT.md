## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for basic functionality.

### Optional Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV=production` (automatically set by Vercel)

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test Codes (Development Mode Only)
Use these fake receipt codes to test the application:

- `12345-06001-42515-05100-00125-7` (Morning visit)
- `03963-06002-42515-07350-00089-4` (Lunch visit)  
- `45678-06003-42515-11250-00234-8` (Evening visit)

**Note:** Test codes only work in development mode. In production, you'll need real McDonald's receipt codes.

### Testing Real Codes
1. Get a McDonald's receipt with a 26-digit survey code
2. Enter the code in the format: `xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-x`
3. The app will automatically complete the survey and return a validation code
